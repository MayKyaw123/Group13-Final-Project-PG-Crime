                <p class="text"> For our project, we decided to build an application that allows users to track the various number of 
                    crimes that have taken place in the county of Prince George's. The concept of this project stemmed from being current residents 
                    of College Park while not knowing much about what goes on in the rest of the county. Being college students at College Park
                     we tend to feel bubbled on campus, many students do not have cars so can only transport with university-provided transportation. 
                     We focused on highlighting the different crimes that take place each day. The users are able to pick 
                     one day from February 2- 21 in 2017; where they will be presented with where the crime took place on the map and a 
                     chart of how many of the crimes took place. In order to make this project we utilized an API that is accessible to the 
                     public on Prince George's County data portal. Using the API we were able to create our application that used 
                     HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
