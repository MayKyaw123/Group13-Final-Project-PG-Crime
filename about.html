                <p class="text"> For our project, we decided to build an application that allows users to track the various number of crimes 
                    that have taken place in Prince George's county. The concept of this project stemmed from us being current residents of 
                    College Park who don't know much about crime occurring in the county. Being college students, we tend to feel bubbled on 
                    campus, and many of us lack knowledge of the surrounding areas. We focused on highlighting the different crimes that take 
                    place each day. The users can either pick one day from February 2- 21 in 2017 or view all crimes during that period. They 
                    will then be able to view a map of crimes and a chart with their respective frequencies. We utilized the Prince George's 
                    County Open API to make this project possible.
