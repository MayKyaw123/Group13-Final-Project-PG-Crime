Web-Application Link:https://maykyaw123.github.io/Group13-Final-Project-PG-Crime/index.html

### Target Browsers
Our target browsers are Google Chrome, Safari, and Microsoft Edge. Our application is also available to be used on iOS and Android

### API
We utilized an API that is accessible to the public on Prince George's County data portal. 
https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/wb4e-w4nf.json.

### Visualizations
We used Leaflet to display a map of the PG County area with map markers for each crime occurrences. Used Chart.js to display a bar chart that displays various different crimes that are committed on the selected day. 

### CSS Frameworks
We used the Flexbox method to design our application inorder to make it responsixe to the sizes needed to be displayed. When using flexboses it allows us to style the application how we intended it to look.

### The users are able to pick one day from February 2- 21 in 2017; where they will be presented with where the crime took place on the map and a chart of how many of the crimes took place. In order to make this project we utilized an API that is accessible to the public on Prince George's County data portal. Using the API we were able to create our application that used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
